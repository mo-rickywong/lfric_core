Quick Start Guide for LFRic
===========================

The LFRic repository includes some small applications for testing and training
purposes. In particular, the :ref:`simple_diffusion <simple diffusion
application>` app is used in LFRic training courses and the :ref:`skeleton
<skeleton application>` app is designed to be an extremely simple and minimal
LFRic app.

A separate ``lfric_apps`` repository holds key science applications, such as
``lfric_atm``. The lfric_apps repository has a different set of instructions for
building and testing apps, but largely they do the same thing.

Check-out a working copy
------------------------

To checkout a working copy of the code to a new directory, named ``trunk`` in
this example, run this command:

.. code-block::

  fcm co https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/lfric/LFRic/trunk trunk

.. topic:: FCM Keywords

   Users of FCM may take advantage of its support for keywords to shorten this.

   Met Office developers should find they can use a site-wide keyword ``lfric.x``

   .. code-block::

      fcm co fcm:lfric.x-tr lfric_core_trunk

   Those without these site-wide keywords can set up their own locally. In
   ``~/.metomi/fcm/keyword.cfg`` just add the following lines:

   .. code-block::

     # LFRic repository
     location{primary}[lfric] = https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/svn/lfric/LFRic

   You may now use the shortened URL:

   .. code-block::

     fcm co fcm:lfric-tr

If keywords are set up, to create a branch and check it out, run the following:

.. code-block::

   fcm bc MyBranchName fcm:lfric.x-tr

The command will create a branch with your chosen name prefixed by the revision
number of the head of trunk. Assuming the current trunk revision is ``1234``,
the branch will be called ``r1234_MyBranchName``. The following checks the code
out and puts it into a directory called a ``working copy``.

.. code-block::

   fcm co r1234_MyBranchName [working_copy_name]

If the working copy name is not specified, it defaults to the name of the branch.

Building an application
-----------------------

The applications can be found in directories within the ``application``
directory. An application can be built by running the ``make`` command from
within its directory.

.. code-block::

  cd r1234_MyBranchName/applications/simple_diffusion
  make

The ``make`` command will build the simple_diffusion executable and place it in
the ``simple_diffusion/bin`` directory. It will also build and run any
integration and unit tests that the application has. The make command uses the
Makefile in the same directory as the application. The Makefile has a number of
optional arguments:

  * ``make build`` builds just the application executable.
  * ``make unit-tests`` builds and runs any the unit tests.
  * ``make integration-tests`` builds and runs any integration tests.

.. warning::

   Instructions for command-line building of an application from the
   lfric_apps repository, such as the lfric_atm atmosphere model, are
   different:

   https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/lfric_apps/wiki/local_builds

   The method is different because it needs to include steps to import external
   code, including the LFRic core code.

The Makefile has a number of optional variable settings that can be
overridden. To see these, look in the file. More than one option can be supplied
in a given invokation of ``make``.

A few of the more commonly used variables are:

 * ``make PROFILE=full-debug`` applies the set of ``full-debug`` compile flags
   rather than the default ``fast-debug`` settings.
 * ``make PSYCLONE_TRANSFORMATION=my_transforms`` applies the ``my_transforms``
   transformations to PSyclone-generated code instead of the default settings
   (which are, typically, either ``minimum`` or ``none``). The ``my_transforms``
   transformation scripts must be defined in the
   ``applications/[app-name]/optimisations`` directory. See PSyclone
   documentation for an explanation.
 * ``make VERBOSE=1``: The verbose option causes output of information
   from the dependency analyser, the compile command for each compilation
   process, and timings of these processes.

In addition to the ``bin`` directory that is created to hold the application
executable, the build process creates a ``working`` directory to hold the
products of an executable build and a ``test`` directory to hold products of a
build of the unit and integration tests.

Running ``make clean`` will remove the working, test and bin directories.

After building an application from the command line, it can be useful to do a
quick test to ensure it can run. Most applications in the lfric and lfric_apps
repository hold a simple example configuration in their ``example`` directory.

After building, go into to the example directory and run the application, as
follows:

.. code-block::

   ../bin/simple_diffusion configuration.nml

The ``configuration.nml`` file contains a set of namelist
configurations. Depending on the application, the ``example`` directory may
contain other files required to run it such as a mesh definition file, a start
dump or other input files.

Running the Cylc test suite
---------------------------

To run the test suites, Cylc and Rose need to be installed.

The ``rose stem`` command selects the group of tests to run. Then ``cylc play``
starts the suite running. For example, to run the developer tests for all the
applications and components within an LFRic working copy, run the following from
the top-level of the working copy:

.. code-block::

   rose stem --group=developer
   cylc play <working_copy_name>
