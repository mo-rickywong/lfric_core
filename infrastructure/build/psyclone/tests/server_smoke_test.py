"""
Smoke test for the persistent PSyclone server (psyclone_server.py) and its
client (psyclone_client.py).

It verifies the properties that the in-process, state-reset design depends on:

1. *Fidelity* - PSy layer produced via the server is byte-for-byte identical
   to that produced by invoking the ``psyclone`` binary directly.
2. *State isolation* - two consecutive jobs handled by the same long-lived
   server, each using a differently-behaving optimisation recipe that happens
   to share the module basename ``global``, do not contaminate one another
   (PSyclone loads recipes by bare basename, so a naive cache would reuse the
   first recipe for the second job).
3. *Lifetime* - the server is pinned to the owning make process: it exits when
   that process does, even when the surrounding process group survives (as it
   does when make is run from a shell script, e.g. by rose-stem).

The test can be run directly (``python server_smoke_test.py``) or under pytest.
