"""
Thin client that submits a single PSyclone job to the persistent
:mod:`psyclone_server` and blocks for the result.

It is a drop-in replacement for the ``psyclone`` command as invoked by
``psyclone_psykal.mk``: everything after the program name is forwarded verbatim
as PSyclone's argument list. The client

* auto-starts the server (once) under a lockfile if it is not running;
* writes the job payload to a per-job directory and sends a *tiny* enqueue
  message (the job-directory path) over the shared request FIFO;
* waits on a per-job response FIFO, replays PSyclone's captured stdout/stderr
  and exits with PSyclone's return code.

Server lifetime is pinned to the build: the *owning* make process is resolved
here (see :func:`_resolve_owner`) and handed to the server, which exits as soon
as that process disappears. The coordination directory is keyed on the same
process, so one server - and only one - serves a whole top-level ``make``,
including all of its recursive sub-makes, and is cleaned up when make finishes.

If anything goes wrong (the server cannot be started, a timeout occurs, or the
protocol is violated) the client transparently falls back to executing the
real ``psyclone`` binary directly so that a build is never broken by the
optimisation.

    Identify the build process the server's lifetime should be pinned to.

    Preference order:

    1. ``PSYCLONE_OWNER_PID`` if it names a live process. The LFRic build sets
       this from ``lfric.mk`` to the pid of the *top-level* make, so every
       recursive sub-make agrees on the same owner.
    2. the outermost make process in this client's ancestry - a robust
       fallback when the makefiles have not been updated, or when PSyclone is
       driven by some other make-based build.
    3. the process group leader, then this client's parent, for invocations
       that have nothing to do with make.

    Watching make itself matters: under a non-interactive shell (rose-stem and
    cylc job scripts) make is *not* the process group leader, so a server that
    watched the process group would outlive a manually killed build.
