"""
Persistent PSyclone server for the LFRic build system.

The server imports PSyclone once and pre-forks a pool of worker processes
(sized to the build parallelism, ``-j``). Each worker keeps PSyclone resident
in memory and executes transformation jobs *in process* by calling
:func:`psyclone.generator.main`, avoiding the repeated cost of loading the
Python interpreter and PSyclone libraries from disk for every algorithm file.

Jobs are submitted by :mod:`psyclone_client` over a shared POSIX FIFO. To keep
submission atomic (a write of no more than ``PIPE_BUF`` bytes is guaranteed not
to be interleaved) the FIFO only ever carries a *tiny enqueue message*: the
path of a per-job directory. The full request payload (argv, cwd, environment)
is written to a regular file in that directory and the result is returned to
the client through a per-job response FIFO.

Protocol (per job)
------------------
* client writes ``<job-dir>\\n`` to the shared request FIFO (atomic);
* dispatcher reads the line and places the job on a shared work queue;
* a worker reads ``<job-dir>/request.json``, runs PSyclone and writes the
  result to the ``<job-dir>/response`` FIFO as ``result.json`` content;
* client reads the response FIFO, replays the captured output and exits with
  the returned code.

The server shuts itself down after ``PSYCLONE_SERVER_IDLE_TIMEOUT`` seconds
without work, so no explicit stop step is required from the build. More
importantly its lifetime is *pinned to the owning make process*
(``PSYCLONE_OWNER_PID``/``PSYCLONE_OWNER_START``, resolved by the client): the
dispatch loop polls that process once a second and exits as soon as it goes
away. A build that finishes normally therefore takes its server with it, and
one that is killed manually - with SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGKILL, at any level of
recursive make - never leaves an orphaned server behind.

State isolation
---------------
Between jobs a worker resets the PSyclone global state that would otherwise
leak from one algorithm file to the next:

* ``Config._instance`` so that a per-job ``--config`` file is honoured;
* ``LFRicConstants.HAS_BEEN_INITIALISED`` so the constants are rebuilt against
  the fresh configuration;
* any modules imported from *user* locations (optimisation recipes loaded via
  ``-s`` and their ``psyclone_tools`` helpers) are purged from
  :data:`sys.modules`, because PSyclone imports recipes by bare basename and
  different components ship different ``global.py``/``<alg>.py`` files that
  would otherwise collide in the module cache.
