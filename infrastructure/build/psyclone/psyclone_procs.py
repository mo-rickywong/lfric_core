"""
Process-inspection helpers shared by :mod:`psyclone_client` and
:mod:`psyclone_server`.

The persistent PSyclone server is deliberately detached from the build (it must
outlive the individual make recipe that happens to start it) so it cannot rely
on the usual parent/child signalling to know when to stop. Instead its lifetime
is *pinned to the make process* that owns the build: the server polls that pid
and exits as soon as it disappears, whether the build ended normally or was
killed manually with SIGINT, SIGTERM or SIGKILL.

Identifying "the make process" is done here:

* :func:`outermost_make_pid` walks the process ancestry via ``/proc`` and
  returns the *outermost* make in the chain, so that recursive sub-makes (the
  LFRic build runs PSyclone from ``$(MAKE) -f psyclone_psykal.mk``) all resolve
  to the same top-level build;
* :func:`owner_alive` reports whether that process is still running, treating a
  zombie as dead and using the process start time to defend against pid reuse.

Note that watching the *process group* is not sufficient: when make is run from
a non-interactive shell script (as it is by rose-stem/cylc) there is no job
control, so make is not the group leader and the group outlives it.
